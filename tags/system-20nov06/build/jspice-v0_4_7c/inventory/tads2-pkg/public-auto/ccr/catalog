			      ADVENTIONS
			 Catalog of Releases


Remember the good old days, when adventure games challenged you with
great puzzles and evocative descriptions without resorting to any
graphics at all?  We at ADVENTIONS really miss that emphasis on
gameplay rather than glitz, and we're commited to writing new games
that are even better than the early text games we liked so much.

We believe the best pictures are the ones you create in your own
mind.  And we know you'll be creating some pretty amazing pictures
when you play our games.

And because our games' graphics and sound capabilities are determined
by *your* hardware rather than your machine's hardware, our
adventures will run on more machines than almost any other commercial
games.  At the time of this writing, we support PC's and clones;
Macintoshes; the Atari ST, TT, and Falcon; Sun 3's and Sparcstations,
DEC MIPS-based workstations runnng Ultrix, NeXT computers, Silicon
Graphics workstations running Irix, 386+ PC's running Linux, and
more.  Amiga versions are in the works, as are versions for other
Unix environments.


Unnkulian Unventure Series
--------------------------

   The Unnkulian Unventures are known world-wide for their excellent
prose, witty irreverence, and top-notch full sentence command interface.
Adventure game devotees raised on now-classic 80's interactive fiction
praise these games for bringing challenging puzzles, vivid characters,
and evocative writing back to the gaming world.

In "Unnkulian Underworld: The Unknown Unventure" you play the part of
Kuulest's slave, and must recover the Orb of Studosity from the evil
Unnkulians.  Kuulest, the old geezebag, has died and left you with
nothing to go on but a cryptic message about saving the planet.
You'll encounter amazing Acme products, the infamous Guardian, those
witty creatures known as Drolls, a giant beaver, and even the Dread
Unnkulian Warrior.  <Gasp!>

In "Unnkulian Unventure II: The Secret of Acme" your adventure
continues as you try to create some good press for yourself --
wouldn't want to fade into anonymous obscurity, now would you?  Along
the way, you'll find the answers to these compelling questions, and
more:

	o What happened to the Unnkulians?
	o Why are Acme products so bad?
	o What is this cheez stuff, really?

Plus, you'll get to explore Dawg Rock, a Duhdist Retreat, Acme's
clandestine prototypes laboratory, and even pay a visit to Acme HQ.

In "Unnkulia One-Half: The Salesman Triumphant," you'll play the role
of a down-and-out Acme salesman, forced to work out of the Golden
Dragon Inn, dangerously near Dread Unnkulia.  Will you accumulate
enough loot in this frightful backwater berg to turn your fortunes in
your favor?

And in "Unnkulia Zero: The Search for Amanda," will you, the Valley
King's most trusted warrior, rescue his Lady Amanda from the gruesome
clutches of the evil Unnkulians?

Along the way to victory (or, <shudder>, defeat!), you will:

	o Find out about the ancient days of the Valley,
	o Meet the King's faithful (but not so bright) Valley Patrol,
	o Explore *beautiful* Lake Draounheer,
	o Discover the ancient burial ground of your ancestors,
	o Become frustrated with the pesky Stoll and his Stoll Bridge,

	and, of course,

	o Meet that wondrously wacky Wowsa Willy!

Further adventures in the ongoing Unnkulian saga are in the works,
and with every new game you learn more about this mystifying (and
hillarious) land and its inhabitants -- benign and malevolent.

Unnkulian Universe Unventure Series
-----------------------------------

   A new chapter in the history of Unnkulia and the Valley unfolds in
this exciting series.  Find out what life is like on planet Tode
(home to Unnkulia and the Valley) and the rest of the Unnkulian
Universe 500 years after "Unnkulian Underworld: The Unknown
Unventure."

   Written by a Ph.D. candidate at the MIT Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory, "The Legend Lives!" is a science fiction epic of
unprecedented depth that explores what can happen when networks and
software get too powerful to control.  As hacker Gavin Kelly, you'll
be at your wits' end tracking down and battling a terrifyingly
powerful virus unleashed on AkNet, the known galaxy's information and
service backbone.  All the while, you'll have to thwart its creator's
attempts to locate and terminate *you*.

   While sticking to the often humorous style of the Unnkulian
Unventures, "The Legend Lives!" nevertheless explores many serious
themes about technology and its effects on society.  "Legend" is not
just a challenging and fun computer game; it is one computer science
researcher's view of a future nearly destroyed by an entirely
synthetic and subtanceless entity -- a software construct.

Other Adventures
----------------

   "The Horror of Rylvania" is true gothic horror in an interactive
fiction setting.  A radical departure from the light-hearted Unnkulian
series, "Horror" is not for the faint-at-heart.  

   What you expected would be a fun outing in scenic Rylvania turns
into a gruesome nightmare, with *you* playing the starring role.  Find
out what it's like to be alternately the source and challenger of evil
in the tiny Eastern European province.  Test your very moral fiber as
you decide to damn yourself and save others -- or vice versa.  "The
Horror of Rylvania" will grip you like no interactive fiction ever
has before.


The Horror of Rylvania
by D. A. Leary
(Now in beta-testing)


   "Colossal Cave Revisted" is a remake of the first major adventure
game ever written: Colossal Cave, otherwise known as "Adventure."
The original Adventure was written in FORTRAN by Willie Crowther and
Don Woods, and had only a simple two word command parser.  Its
descriptions were so vivid, however, that it captivated a generation
of computer enthusiasts and quickly became part of the "hacker lore."

   ADVENTIONS' implementation of this classic features the same
excellent full sentence parser our other games use, and comes with
complete source code.  For those new to interactive fiction, "Colossal
Cave Revisited" is a must-have.
