This package includes several tutorial example classes that should be suffient
to give you a good understanding of main package.  The examples are graded and  each one is
separated documented.  The simplest example is called TrivialExample and the next is
BasicExample.  The highest level example is PoplogExample which illustrates
how to write a worker that communicates asynchronously with a running Poplog process
via serialized XML documents.
