This package is an initial draft for a messaging service which might be made obsolete by
other industry efforts such as JMS.

<p>The metaphor used by the package is that of a busy office.  The office is staffed by many workers who
coordinate their work by sending and receiving letters from both the outside world and each other.  Workers
have names and roles.  The office will find a worker by name or role when asked.
</p>

<p>A letter has only three mandatory fields: the subject, the from field and the to field.  The contents of
the letter are built up either by appending values (like a list) or associating values with keys.  A worker
is free to interpret these fields as they will.
</p>

<p>Each worker has an in-tray for receiving letters and some (zero or more) out-trays for sending letters.
The workers always process their incoming letters in the sequence they arrived.  This processing typically
causes further letters to be written and inserted into the out-trays.  When a letter is put into an out-tray
it is immediately copied to all the connected in-trays.  Out-trays are named in the same way as workers.
</p>

<p>For example, if a worker Bob should always be notified about a worker Alice's work, then Alice's out-tray
should be connected to Bob's in-tray.  Many workers' in-trays may be connected to a single out-tray.  Every
time a letter is put in the out-tray, the connected in-trays automatically receive a copy.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, if Alice dynamically decides who the out-going letter should be sent to, then she will explicitly
address the letter to a particular worker.  That way it will bypass the out-tray system completely.  A common
example of this is a simple reply; replying means addressing a letter to the sender of the letter being processed.
</p>

<p>When the last message has been sent to a worker they should be told to finish-off.  The worker will immediately
close its in-tray, refusing further messages, process all outstanding letters and then close all out-trays.
</p>

<p>Workers such as Alice and Bob can be implemented in several different ways.  They could be lightweight objects,
middleweight threads, or heavyweight processes.  It doesn't matter as the classes are thread safe.
