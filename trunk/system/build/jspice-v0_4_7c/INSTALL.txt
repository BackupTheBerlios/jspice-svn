Installing JSpice
-----------------

1.  Unpack the distribution.

2.  It will create a directory called
        jspice-vXXX
    where XXX is the distribution version number.  The name and location of 
    this directory does not matter.  We suggest moving it to either /usr/local
    or ~/local.
    
3.  We will call the jspice-vXXX diectory the base directory, BASEDIR.

4.  To execute the interpreter, use
        BASEDIR/bin/jspice
    You can put this on your $PATH or make a symbolic link to your 
    ~/bin for convenience.  (If you want to use the other convenience 
    scripts that are bundled in the same directory, you'll need to 
    put it on your $PATH.)
