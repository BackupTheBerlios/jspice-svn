==                  Changes in Reverse Chronological Order                 ==
#############################################################################

=== Version 0.4.7, 29th July 2004 ===

  * Added suchthat (filter) to for loops.
  
  * Fixed bug in Pragma expansion

=== Version 0.4.6, 29th July 2004 ===

  * Added short lambdas: e.g. ( x => x + 1 )
  	(Spotted by GJH)

=== Version 0.4.5, 29th July 2004 ===

  * Added isEmpty, isList, isMap, isListFlavour, isMapFlavour, isString 
    with summaries.

=== Version 0.4.4, 28th July 2004 ===

  * Added newSymbol and symbolString.

  * Added elementName, elementAttributes and elementChildren.  Gave them
    summaries.
    
  * Added full error handling for allButFirst, allButLast, justFirst and
    justLast, head, tail and last.
    
  * Fixed bug in assigning to (var x).  (Thanks to GJH for spotting this.)
  
  * Prompt now configurable in jspice.conf.
  
  * Added personal configuration ( ~/.jspice/jspice.conf).

=== Version 0.4.3 ===

  * Added attributeMap and tagName to stdlib.

  * Standardized prompt now invisible to the compiler.
  
  * addFirst and addLast functions added.
  
  * Fixed bug in tag syntax when more than one attribute was used.

=== Version 0.4.2, 24th July 2004 ===

  * Added functions newList and newMap (compatible with MillScript.)
  
  * Added {% ... %} syntax for creating immutable Maps.

  * Added new #list pragma for listing the contents of packages.
  
  * New self-describing summaries for procedures in order to support the
    #list pragma.
    
  * Fixed bug in compilation of simple assignments!
  
  * Improved error messages when updating immutable objects.

=== Version 0.4.1, July 23rd 2004 ===

  * New list processing functions: 
        head/first, tail
        reverse, cons, snoc
        allButFirst, allButLast, justFirst, justLast
        
  * The lexis of "-:" was broken.  Fixed.
  
  * Fixed a bug in the lexis of 
       3.last
    which meant that the three was being converted to floating point.

=== Version 0.4.0, 22nd July 2004 ===

  * Massive reengineering of the autoloading mechanism to go thru 
    a very narrow "virtual filing system" interface.  Hopefully this will
    buy a great deal of flexibility in the future.
    
    However, this has probably introduced a slew of teething problems which
    I will have to work thru as they crop up.

  * Added #load macro in preparation for emacs intergration.

  * Fixed the trailing semi-colon bug.
  
  * Improved error reporting when faults appear in the head of
    a definition (#2020)
    
  * Fixed a long-standing bug in the way phase is reported.

  * Major reorganization of code to utilize modules.
  
  * Fixed the implementation of Culprit and CulpritList in the alert
    package - eliminating CulpritGroup altogether.

=== Version 0.3.12 ===

  * Tab completion for pragmas implemented.

  * Several bug fixes for JLine.
  
  * Basic preparation for complex numbers.  Operators "+:" and "-:"
    added i.e. same convention as Pop-11.  Complex numbers work with
    +, -, * and /.  The scientific routines won't work with them yet,
    apart from sqrt.
    
  * Added the #quit pragma that forces the system to exit.  The
    #exit pragma is a synonym for UNIX sysadmins.  This supercedes
    the IntelliJHack (***) which has been withdrawn.


=== Version 0.3.11 ===

  * Added experimental function openURL( String ).
  
  * Added format function.
  

=== Version 0.3.10 ===

  * Rewrote pragma code to clean up the treatment of manuals.  But
    it is still the case that extensions other than *.txt are ignored.
    
  * Added completion to the readline capabilities.  Had to hack JLine
    to get the right effect, which was a bit of a pity.
    
  * The TADS2 interpreter now free of global variables.  As a consequence
    you can run multiple instances in several threads without them
    interfering with each other.

=== Version 0.3.9 ===

  * Jetty servlet container included.  This is a highly experimental piece of
    code that tries to encapsulate the console-driven applications.

  * lastResults() added.
  
  * loadValueFromFile added.
  
  * Fixed ccr.gam.
  
  * Eliminated CharacterEntity.java in favour of new directive in 
    jspice.conf.  This makes the set of entities configurable.
    
  * Non-standard syntax added for deferred values (=| STMNTS |=).
    This exposes deferred values for programming.
    
  * Pragma for checking and changing the debug status added.
        #debug [on|off]
        
  * New "lite" distribution added that omits source code, javadocs,
    and the TADS2 package.
  
  
=== Version 0.3.8 ===

  * Fix tokenization of floating point numbers in expressions such
    as "2.sqrt"
      
  * Reorganized lexis code in order to share escape parsing with the
    Wiki parser.  Also lifted the classes and interfaces of Tokenizer.java
    into individual files - simply because IDEA and other IDEs like it that
    way.
    
  * Added CSV and TSV loader.
    
  * Fixed long standing bug in the way XML elements print out.
  
  * Fixed recently introduced bug in the number lexer.

=== Version 0.3.7 ===

  * Added math routines:
        sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, atan2,
        log, log2, log10,
        ceil, floor, round, abs,
        sqrt, pow,
        toDegrees, toRadians
        
  * Data inspector "inspect" added.

=== Version 0.3.6 ===

  * Fixed error message for bad comments.  (Was reporting ASCII code.)
  
  * Very basic help system in place.  Exploiting newly created # code
    for the following pragmas.
        #help <topic>
        #licence <topic>
        #conditions <topic>
        #warranty <topic>
    This is very crude but a reasonable starting place.
    
  * Added a simple but effective form of readline courtesy of JLine.  
    See
        #licence jline

=== Version 0.3.5 ===

  * Brought definitions of unary + & - up to date (bug #002038).
  
  * Eliminated old, redundant arithmetic libraries.
  
  * Fixed usage of TADS2 interpreter (bug #002043 raised by GJH).
  
  * Sorted out licensing issues for TADS2 games.  Several games 
    are now bundled by default into the distribution.
  
  * Eliminated debug messages when importing.


=== Version 0.3.4 ===

  * Numerical comparison now implemented.
  
  * Long standing bug in comparison of values with different run-time types
    fixed.  Used java.lang.Object.equals which has a tendency to throw
    ClassCastExceptions with the slightest provocation.

  * Added tokenization of floating points and big integers.
  
  * Fixed default right associatively in parser - should always have been
    left associative.

=== Version 0.3.3 ===

  * Reimplemented arithmetic completely.  Now handles Integer, BigInteger,
    and Double.  However, there is no guaranteed canonization of small
    numbers - indeed, there cannot be!  This is a bit of a problem for 
    implementing ==.
    
    This prepares the ground for the full Spice implementation of numbers.
    
  * Fixed an error reporting problem - tokens were printing wrongly in
    compiler errors.  (Pointed out by Aaron Sloman.)

=== Version 0.3.2 ===

  * CVS integration: cvs.jspice.berlios.de
  
  * Added slot updaters
  
  * Broke up massive Proc class by removing the myriad static inner
    classes and moving them into the built_in package where they belong.
    In the process introduced built_in.ShortCut to take over the role
    of the short-cut lookups in Proc.  This isn't a very satisfactory class
    and needs some attention.

=== Version 0.3.1, 18th June 2004 ===

  * Minimal slots supported - without updaters!  So don't expect to do
    anything exciting with them for a while.
    
        define class Foo; slot alpha; enddefine
        
    Slot code is generated on the fly which is quite interesting and
    complicated. 
    
  * Trying to make slot update work exposed a nasty bug in the assignment
    code.  Fixed.

=== Version 0.3.0 ===

  * Added the very initial stages of the "define class" syntax.
  
  * Created framework for dynamic class and method construction.  See
    JSpiceClassLoader for details.

=== Version 0.2.11 ===

  * Changed long comments to meet resolution on long comments.  The
    closing bracket is now "#)" rather than ")#".

=== Version 0.2.10 ===

  * Added new Deferred data type - not sure whether this is an idea that
    will work.  However, shifted to loading images this way after 
    investigation showed that image-delegation triggers a VM bug.
    
  * Importantly, the mapping from extensions to LoaderBuilders is now
    done in jspice.conf and not an internal map.

=== Version 0.2.9 ===

  * Fixed bug in autoloading which disabled most formats.

=== Version 0.2.8 ===

  * Java serialization format now supported (*.ser)
  
  * Autoloading supports image formats (*.gif, *.png and maybe *.jpg).
  
  * Autoloading supports TADS2 and Brain*** as well :-)
  
  * Fixed nasty bug in explode for maps - improved efficiency at the
    same time.

=== Version 0.2.7 ===

  * Lots of new autoloadable formats added.  The list now includes:
      * Arbitrary Spice expressions (*.expr)
      * Single lines loaded as a String (*.line)
      * Multiple lines loaded as a List of String (*.lines)
      * Maps with string or symbol keys (*-map/*.* and *-symtab/*.*)
      * Properties loaded as a Map (*.prop)
      * Spice definitions (*.spi)
      * Text files loaded as a String (*.txt)
      * URIs and URLS (*.uri and *.url)
      * XML files loaded as an Element (*.xml) 

=== Version 0.2.6 ===

  * Long comments now nest!  (I forgot this was part of the spec!)

=== Version 0.2.5 ===

  * Long comments added.

=== Version 0.2.4 ===

  * Added termin to the standard name space.
  
  * Added repeater machinery.  Not sure if it is going to be useful.
  
  * getEnv function changed to environment_variable - which now acts as
    a mutable Map.  The '${' syntax now works in update mode.
        ${NAME} := VALUE
    
    
== Version 0.2.3 ===

  * Added split, which was missing from the group of regular expression
    operators.
    
  * Added getEnv function.  This requires a vile patch to the bin/jspice
    file.  But as Java doesn't directly support accessing environment 
    variables, what can one do?

=== Version 0.2.2 ===

  * Added basic regular expressions.
  
=== Version 0.2.1 ===

  * Autoloading of multiple languages added.
 
=== Version 0.2 ===

  * Autoloading added.

=== Version 0.1.7 ===

  * The Spice interpreter is now fully subsumed into the multi-language
    loader framework - phew!  
    
  * The current name-space tracker is now integrated into the loader 
    framework.  (As a consequence, the concept of current name space is
    now subsystem dependent.)
    

=== Version 0.1.6 ===

  * Continued with meeting GPL licence requirements.  Now prints appropriate
    banner in interactive mode.  However, the ACME servlet licence is not
    properly met - as this is not actually used (yet) this is not an urgent 
    issue.
    
  * Yet more configuration machinery.  The system now looks for its system
    wide configuration file, remembers its installation directory, and 
    complains properly if it cannot figure out the context.
  
=== Version 0.1.5 ===

  * More configuration machinery added.  The multi-language loader (SuperLoader)
    being pushed into all the right places.

=== Version 0.1.4 ===

  * Added copyright notices to all source files.
 
  * Added configuration machinery, not yet complete
      * For JSpice system-wide
      * For Inventories (package collections)
      * So that importing will autoload packages
      * And so that file autoloading can be implemented
      
  * Added super-loader in preparation for multiple languages
  
  * Now checks that the version numbers are in agreement
      
=== Version 0.1.3, 1st May 2004 ===

  * Fixed bug #16 "NPE after = expression" 
  
  * Turned this file into Wiki format.  Its just a thought at this stage.

=== Version 0.1.2 ===

  * JSpice interpreter now announces version number.

  * Created convenience scripts. 
      * jspice-make-inventory
      * jspice-make-package


=== Version 0.1.1 ===

  * Added the bin directory


=== Version 0.1.0 ===

  * Initial release
