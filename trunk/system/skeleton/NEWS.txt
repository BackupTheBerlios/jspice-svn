==                  Changes in Reverse Chronological Order                 ==
#############################################################################

=== Version 0.5.0 ==

  * New asynchronous message processing core added.  This has the potential
  	to be a major addition to the system and is the key to integrating
  	web services.  This corresponds to version 0.5 on the roadmap and the
  	version number has been advanced correspondingly.

  * #version pragma enhanced.  The way version information for all the 
  	components of JSpice is significantly improved.
  	
  * Supplied new implementations for the value stack and call stack of
  	the virtual machine - paralleling work done in MillScript by Kevin
  	Rogers.
  	

=== Version 0.4.17, 30th Nov 2004 ===

  * New "#java" pragma added for direct importing of Java classes and
  	methods.
  	
  * Apply-actions added.  Many objects can now be applied as if they
  	were functions.

  * '==' now works on numbers, as discussed in recent OpenSpice Design Meeting.
  
  * RegEx interface enhanced.  New routines for manipulating Bindings added.
  
  * RegEx flags now accepted:
  	* i = case-insensitive
  	* u = extends case-insensitivity to unicode
  	* s = 'dotall' - allows dot to match the termninator character
  	* m = multi-line
  	* d = unix lines
  	* x = comments
  	
  * Procedures now 'show' more sensibly (although not well).
  
  * Assignments to "val" identifiers now intercepted and reported.
  	
  * A couple of subtle bugs in string interpolation (caused by using
  	a shared HashMap rather than a copied TreeMap) have been squashed.
  	
  * Internal restructuring, moved "office" messaging out from Core.
  
  * Internal renaming - aim is to eliminate use of "jspice" internally
  	in order to do a complete project rename in the future.  There 
  	already exists a project called JSPICE, so we should aim to avoid
  	conflict.
  	
  * Fixed nasty bug in Arity class - could have caused all sorts of
  	problems.
  	
=== Version 0.4.16, 27th Oct 2004 ===

  * "Showing" now properly escapes tabs, carriage returns and newlines.
  
  * Considerable revision of the XmlElement implementation after discussion
  	with Kevin Rogers.  Now a great deal more precise about when sharing is
  	permitted - efficiency issues are secondary and this will cause gains
  	and losses in speed - however compactness will be improved.
  	
  * Renaming of isListFlavour to isListLike, isMapFlavour to 
  	isMapLike following OpenSpice Design Meeting.
  	
  * Upgraded Jetty to version 5.0.0.
  
  * Added #versions pragma.
  	
=== Version 0.4.15 , 15th Sep 2004 ===

  * Improved reserved word error messages.
  
  * Added quasiquoting.  This is an experimental addition, not 
  	intended to be final.  The main shortcoming is that it does
  	not deal with embedded tags.
  	
  * A simple pretty-printer pprint has been added.

=== Version 0.4.14, 20th Aug 2004 ===

  * Implemented string interpolation e.g. "1 hour = \(60*60) secs"

  * Reworked code in Shortcuts to eliminate superfluous objects and
    follow internal design guidelines.  Discover and fix bug in mod & div 
    that were introduced by a misfeature in IDEAs refactoring.

=== Version 0.4.13, 13th Aug 2004 ===

  * mapletKey, mapletValue, newMaplet, elementChildren
  
  * Fixed critical bug in startup (did not properly test for absence of
    personal jspice.conf file).
    

=== Version 0.4.12, 12th Aug 2004 ===

  * Fixed bug in lexical classification of </> which prevented the 
    anonymous closer from working.
    
  * An XML printing bug, exposed by Luc's big_kit example, has been fixed.
    
  * Made startup a little more robust in the case where the VM parameters
    are wrong.


=== Version 0.4.11, 11th Aug 2004 ===

  * Several end of file handling bugs fixed.

  * XML element equality now works properly - bug fix.

  * Fixed bug in for-loop syntax introduced when clumsily incorporating
    Luc's suggestion of optional semis.

  * isNumber was hidden - fixed.
  
  * Started incorporation of JUnit testing.
  
  * Extensive reworking of the virtual filing system concept.  Much 
    better design.  Changed naming conventions again after much
    squirming.


=== Version 0.4.10, 4th Aug 2004 ===

  * Added predicates isNumber, isCharacter, isBoolean, isTermin, isAbsent,
    isMaplet, isElement, isMaplet, and isSymbol.
    
  * Added function newElement.
  
  * Command line options now available.
        * --banner[=(on|off)], prints the startup banner
        * --help[=(on|off)], prints an initial help file
        * --jline[=(on|off)], enables interactive command-line editing
        * --prompt=<string>, sets the prompt to <string>
        * --splash[=(on|off)], displays a 'splash' image at start up
        * --version[=(on|off)], reports version then quits
        
  * Splash image feature added.  (Application name = JSpice only on Mac OS X.)
        
  * Fixed bug in #list pragma (forgot to check namespace existed).
    
=== Version 0.4.9, 3rd Aug 2004 ===

  * Treatment of Strings significantly enhanced.  The class-peer arrangement
    has been updated as follows:
        * Spice String --> Java CharSequence
        * Spice ImmutableString --> Java String
        * Spice MutableString --> Java StringBuffer
    The function newString now returns mutable strings, as expected.  This
    is likely to cause some knock-on problems as it is a very deep and
    intrusive change.
    
  * #entities pragma added.  Takes optional regular expression and lists
    matching character entities.
    
  * Minor relaxation of syntax of for loops - semi-colons always
    permitted between iterators, filters and exit conditions.
    
  * Added 'OneChar' style warning to the #style pragma.  Can be configured
    in ~/.jspice/jspice.conf or dynamically via pragma.
    
  * Enhanced #list pragma - a minor bug fix and improved signature reporting
    for undocumented functions.

  * Added the #autoloaders pragma which lists the autoloaders that
    are in force.
    
  * Fixed bug in the compilation of conditionals.  (Actually completed the
    compilation of conditionals as this was a known omissions.)

  * Enhanced configuration file parsing with Spice string compatibility.
  
  * Preparation for RPM support including enhanced version reporting 
    capabilities.  Changed the suffixes "-full" and "-lite" to 
    "-source" and "-runtime" respectively to fit in with RPM naming
    convention.
    
  * Fixed bug caused by intrusive debugging that generated extraneous
    printouts when reading in escape sequences in strings.
    
  * Eliminated duplicate NotEqualsProc class.

=== Version 0.4.8, 30th July 2004 ===

  * Dot syntax enhanced and makes use of DotRHS style warning.
  
  * Style warning framework added.  
    This includes #style the style-warning pragma and
    the StyleWarning configuration directive.
    
  * Fixed a bug in manual pragmas caused by the switchover to VFS.
  
  * Fixed a bug in syntax for parentheses caused by adding lambda shorthand.

=== Version 0.4.7, 29th July 2004 ===

  * Added suchthat (filter) to for loops.
  
  * Fixed bug in Pragma expansion

=== Version 0.4.6, 29th July 2004 ===

  * Added short lambdas: e.g. ( x => x + 1 )
    (Spotted by GJH)

=== Version 0.4.5, 29th July 2004 ===

  * Added isEmpty, isList, isMap, isListFlavour, isMapFlavour, isString 
    with summaries.

=== Version 0.4.4, 28th July 2004 ===

  * Added newSymbol and symbolString.

  * Added elementName, elementAttributes and elementChildren.  Gave them
    summaries.
    
  * Added full error handling for allButFirst, allButLast, justFirst and
    justLast, head, tail and last.
    
  * Fixed bug in assigning to (var x).  (Thanks to GJH for spotting this.)
  
  * Prompt now configurable in jspice.conf.
  
  * Added personal configuration ( ~/.jspice/jspice.conf).

=== Version 0.4.3 ===

  * Added attributeMap and tagName to stdlib.

  * Standardized prompt now invisible to the compiler.
  
  * addFirst and addLast functions added.
  
  * Fixed bug in tag syntax when more than one attribute was used.

=== Version 0.4.2, 24th July 2004 ===

  * Added functions newList and newMap (compatible with MillScript.)
  
  * Added {% ... %} syntax for creating immutable Maps.

  * Added new #list pragma for listing the contents of packages.
  
  * New self-describing summaries for procedures in order to support the
    #list pragma.
    
  * Fixed bug in compilation of simple assignments!
  
  * Improved error messages when updating immutable objects.

=== Version 0.4.1, July 23rd 2004 ===

  * New list processing functions: 
        head/first, tail
        reverse, cons, snoc
        allButFirst, allButLast, justFirst, justLast
        
  * The lexis of "-:" was broken.  Fixed.
  
  * Fixed a bug in the lexis of 
       3.last
    which meant that the three was being converted to floating point.

=== Version 0.4.0, 22nd July 2004 ===

  * Massive reengineering of the autoloading mechanism to go thru 
    a very narrow "virtual filing system" interface.  Hopefully this will
    buy a great deal of flexibility in the future.
    
    However, this has probably introduced a slew of teething problems which
    I will have to work thru as they crop up.

  * Added #load macro in preparation for emacs intergration.

  * Fixed the trailing semi-colon bug.
  
  * Improved error reporting when faults appear in the head of
    a definition (#2020)
    
  * Fixed a long-standing bug in the way phase is reported.

  * Major reorganization of code to utilize modules.
  
  * Fixed the implementation of Culprit and CulpritList in the alert
    package - eliminating CulpritGroup altogether.

=== Version 0.3.12 ===

  * Tab completion for pragmas implemented.

  * Several bug fixes for JLine.
  
  * Basic preparation for complex numbers.  Operators "+:" and "-:"
    added i.e. same convention as Pop-11.  Complex numbers work with
    +, -, * and /.  The scientific routines won't work with them yet,
    apart from sqrt.
    
  * Added the #quit pragma that forces the system to exit.  The
    #exit pragma is a synonym for UNIX sysadmins.  This supercedes
    the IntelliJHack (***) which has been withdrawn.


=== Version 0.3.11 ===

  * Added experimental function openURL( String ).
  
  * Added format function.
  

=== Version 0.3.10 ===

  * Rewrote pragma code to clean up the treatment of manuals.  But
    it is still the case that extensions other than *.txt are ignored.
    
  * Added completion to the readline capabilities.  Had to hack JLine
    to get the right effect, which was a bit of a pity.
    
  * The TADS2 interpreter now free of global variables.  As a consequence
    you can run multiple instances in several threads without them
    interfering with each other.

=== Version 0.3.9 ===

  * Jetty servlet container included.  This is a highly experimental piece of
    code that tries to encapsulate the console-driven applications.

  * lastResults() added.
  
  * loadValueFromFile added.
  
  * Fixed ccr.gam.
  
  * Eliminated CharacterEntity.java in favour of new directive in 
    jspice.conf.  This makes the set of entities configurable.
    
  * Non-standard syntax added for deferred values (=| STMNTS |=).
    This exposes deferred values for programming.
    
  * Pragma for checking and changing the debug status added.
        #debug [on|off]
        
  * New "lite" distribution added that omits source code, javadocs,
    and the TADS2 package.
  
  
=== Version 0.3.8 ===

  * Fix tokenization of floating point numbers in expressions such
    as "2.sqrt"
      
  * Reorganized lexis code in order to share escape parsing with the
    Wiki parser.  Also lifted the classes and interfaces of Tokenizer.java
    into individual files - simply because IDEA and other IDEs like it that
    way.
    
  * Added CSV and TSV loader.
    
  * Fixed long standing bug in the way XML elements print out.
  
  * Fixed recently introduced bug in the number lexer.

=== Version 0.3.7 ===

  * Added math routines:
        sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, atan2,
        log, log2, log10,
        ceil, floor, round, abs,
        sqrt, pow,
        toDegrees, toRadians
        
  * Data inspector "inspect" added.

=== Version 0.3.6 ===

  * Fixed error message for bad comments.  (Was reporting ASCII code.)
  
  * Very basic help system in place.  Exploiting newly created # code
    for the following pragmas.
        #help <topic>
        #licence <topic>
        #conditions <topic>
        #warranty <topic>
    This is very crude but a reasonable starting place.
    
  * Added a simple but effective form of readline courtesy of JLine.  
    See
        #licence jline

=== Version 0.3.5 ===

  * Brought definitions of unary + & - up to date (bug #002038).
  
  * Eliminated old, redundant arithmetic libraries.
  
  * Fixed usage of TADS2 interpreter (bug #002043 raised by GJH).
  
  * Sorted out licensing issues for TADS2 games.  Several games 
    are now bundled by default into the distribution.
  
  * Eliminated debug messages when importing.


=== Version 0.3.4 ===

  * Numerical comparison now implemented.
  
  * Long standing bug in comparison of values with different run-time types
    fixed.  Used java.lang.Object.equals which has a tendency to throw
    ClassCastExceptions with the slightest provocation.

  * Added tokenization of floating points and big integers.
  
  * Fixed default right associatively in parser - should always have been
    left associative.

=== Version 0.3.3 ===

  * Reimplemented arithmetic completely.  Now handles Integer, BigInteger,
    and Double.  However, there is no guaranteed canonization of small
    numbers - indeed, there cannot be!  This is a bit of a problem for 
    implementing ==.
    
    This prepares the ground for the full Spice implementation of numbers.
    
  * Fixed an error reporting problem - tokens were printing wrongly in
    compiler errors.  (Pointed out by Aaron Sloman.)

=== Version 0.3.2 ===

  * CVS integration: cvs.jspice.berlios.de
  
  * Added slot updaters
  
  * Broke up massive Proc class by removing the myriad static inner
    classes and moving them into the built_in package where they belong.
    In the process introduced built_in.ShortCut to take over the role
    of the short-cut lookups in Proc.  This isn't a very satisfactory class
    and needs some attention.

=== Version 0.3.1, 18th June 2004 ===

  * Minimal slots supported - without updaters!  So don't expect to do
    anything exciting with them for a while.
    
        define class Foo; slot alpha; enddefine
        
    Slot code is generated on the fly which is quite interesting and
    complicated. 
    
  * Trying to make slot update work exposed a nasty bug in the assignment
    code.  Fixed.

=== Version 0.3.0 ===

  * Added the very initial stages of the "define class" syntax.
  
  * Created framework for dynamic class and method construction.  See
    JSpiceClassLoader for details.

=== Version 0.2.11 ===

  * Changed long comments to meet resolution on long comments.  The
    closing bracket is now "#)" rather than ")#".

=== Version 0.2.10 ===

  * Added new Deferred data type - not sure whether this is an idea that
    will work.  However, shifted to loading images this way after 
    investigation showed that image-delegation triggers a VM bug.
    
  * Importantly, the mapping from extensions to LoaderBuilders is now
    done in jspice.conf and not an internal map.

=== Version 0.2.9 ===

  * Fixed bug in autoloading which disabled most formats.

=== Version 0.2.8 ===

  * Java serialization format now supported (*.ser)
  
  * Autoloading supports image formats (*.gif, *.png and maybe *.jpg).
  
  * Autoloading supports TADS2 and Brain*** as well :-)
  
  * Fixed nasty bug in explode for maps - improved efficiency at the
    same time.

=== Version 0.2.7 ===

  * Lots of new autoloadable formats added.  The list now includes:
      * Arbitrary Spice expressions (*.expr)
      * Single lines loaded as a String (*.line)
      * Multiple lines loaded as a List of String (*.lines)
      * Maps with string or symbol keys (*-map/*.* and *-symtab/*.*)
      * Properties loaded as a Map (*.prop)
      * Spice definitions (*.spi)
      * Text files loaded as a String (*.txt)
      * URIs and URLS (*.uri and *.url)
      * XML files loaded as an Element (*.xml) 

=== Version 0.2.6 ===

  * Long comments now nest!  (I forgot this was part of the spec!)

=== Version 0.2.5 ===

  * Long comments added.

=== Version 0.2.4 ===

  * Added termin to the standard name space.
  
  * Added repeater machinery.  Not sure if it is going to be useful.
  
  * getEnv function changed to environment_variable - which now acts as
    a mutable Map.  The '${' syntax now works in update mode.
        ${NAME} := VALUE
    
    
== Version 0.2.3 ===

  * Added split, which was missing from the group of regular expression
    operators.
    
  * Added getEnv function.  This requires a vile patch to the bin/jspice
    file.  But as Java doesn't directly support accessing environment 
    variables, what can one do?

=== Version 0.2.2 ===

  * Added basic regular expressions.
  
=== Version 0.2.1 ===

  * Autoloading of multiple languages added.
 
=== Version 0.2 ===

  * Autoloading added.

=== Version 0.1.7 ===

  * The Spice interpreter is now fully subsumed into the multi-language
    loader framework - phew!  
    
  * The current name-space tracker is now integrated into the loader 
    framework.  (As a consequence, the concept of current name space is
    now subsystem dependent.)
    

=== Version 0.1.6 ===

  * Continued with meeting GPL licence requirements.  Now prints appropriate
    banner in interactive mode.  However, the ACME servlet licence is not
    properly met - as this is not actually used (yet) this is not an urgent 
    issue.
    
  * Yet more configuration machinery.  The system now looks for its system
    wide configuration file, remembers its installation directory, and 
    complains properly if it cannot figure out the context.
  
=== Version 0.1.5 ===

  * More configuration machinery added.  The multi-language loader (SuperLoader)
    being pushed into all the right places.

=== Version 0.1.4 ===

  * Added copyright notices to all source files.
 
  * Added configuration machinery, not yet complete
      * For JSpice system-wide
      * For Inventories (package collections)
      * So that importing will autoload packages
      * And so that file autoloading can be implemented
      
  * Added super-loader in preparation for multiple languages
  
  * Now checks that the version numbers are in agreement
      
=== Version 0.1.3, 1st May 2004 ===

  * Fixed bug #16 "NPE after = expression" 
  
  * Turned this file into Wiki format.  Its just a thought at this stage.

=== Version 0.1.2 ===

  * JSpice interpreter now announces version number.

  * Created convenience scripts. 
      * jspice-make-inventory
      * jspice-make-package


=== Version 0.1.1 ===

  * Added the bin directory


=== Version 0.1.0 ===

  * Initial release
